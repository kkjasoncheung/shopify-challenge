# Shopify Challenge

**Access the app live on Heroku! https://shopify-intern-challenge.herokuapp.com/**

This project was created for the Shopify Winter 2018 Web Developer Intern position.

With this app, you are able to search GitHub's repositories (showing the top 10 results) and favourite them. Accidentally closed your tab? **No worries!** The favourited repos are stored on local storage so even if you've closed all your tabs, they will be there the next time you navigate to the app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Run locally/Development Server

1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/kkjasoncheung/shopify-challenge.git`
2. Change directory to the root of the application: `cd ./shopify-challenge`.
3. Install dependencies `npm i`
4. Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

**Voila!**

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
